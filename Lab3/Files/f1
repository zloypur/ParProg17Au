Along with journalists from the Shanghai newspaper Shibao (Eastern Times), by 1909 "the most widely circulated newspaper in the Shanghai region,"[4] Shi was a regular visitor to "an association known as the Xilou (Resting Place), which Shibao sponsored and where several items of the late-Qing reformist agenda were argued and shaped."[5] When he took over Shen Bao in 1912, he furthered its liberal orientation; he also began a career as a press magnate, and from 1927, he bought up most of the stock of Shishi and Xinwen newspapers.[3] He also expanded his range of business interests, with investments in cotton textiles.

He was the leader of the Jiangning tongxianghui (native place association) until his death; such associations in this period frequently "provided shelter and resources for anti-Japanese activists," and this one did not officially call a meeting between 1928 and 1933 because of a desire to avoid having to comply with oppressive Kuomintang regulations.[6] "In the 1930s, Shi was a strong supporter of the Human Rights Defence Alliance established by Madam Soong Qing Ling, the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat-sen, with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun."[7] He "had remained aloof from the initial phase of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association promoted in July 1931 by the Shanghai KMT and its auxiliary Chamber of Commerce,"[8] but after the Mukden Incident in September he became more involved, and in January 1932 "offered his nonpartisan leadership over a reconstituted anti-Japanese association and use of his Shenpao newspaper."
