The government of Uganda has earmarked this road for upgrading through the conversion of the existing gravel road to bitumen surface and the building of bridges, shoulders, and drainage channels. Application has been made for a loan from the World Bank to fund the upgrade.[5][6] In August 2015, the World Bank committed to lend US$145 million (about UGX:526 billion) to the Uganda government to pave this road and improve the access of the local population to education and other social economic services.[7] A Chinese company has been awarded the contract, at a budgeted cost of UGX:214 billion and with commissioning expected in 2019.[8]
